# Music-Player

The LCD will display a menu that allows the user to select, pause, and play songs. The joystick should control a cursor that is used to navigate the menu. The buzzer should play corresponding notes of a song.

The user can select a song from 3 pre-saved choices.

Once the user has selected a song, the menu changes to show the playing song screen

The user may pause and resume the current song by moving the cursor to select and press the "pause" or "resume" options on the menu
